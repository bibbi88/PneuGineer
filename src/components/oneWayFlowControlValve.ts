// lines and their fittings, as on the reference icon this was redrawn from). The reference - and
// this component, rotated 90° CCW from an earlier horizontal IN-left/OUT-right layout to match
// it - is drawn vertically: IN at the bottom, OUT at the top, the throttle branch offset to one
// side. Because this orientation matches the reference directly, the decorative glyphs below are
// its own path data, verbatim, just scaled and translated into place (no rotation component
// needed in that transform) - so every relationship in the source, in particular how far the
// chevron's tip pokes out past the circle, survives untouched. Only the plain straight lines (the
// two ports-to-ports paths) are drawn fresh, in native coordinates, to avoid inheriting the
// reference's long lead-line stubs.
//
// All of the tunable numbers live in `OneWayFlowGeometry` / `ONE_WAY_FLOW_DEFAULT_GEOMETRY`

// as a parameter rather than reading module constants directly - both so the real component
// and the symbol-lab dev tool (tools/symbol-lab.html) render from the exact same code, and so
// tweaking a shape never means hand-copying numbers between two divergent implementations.
