/**
 * Replaces `comp` with a fresh component of `newType` at the same position, reconnecting every
 * wire that touched it. Used to "convert" between component types that differ enough in behavior
 * and artwork to stay separate types rather than one togglable mode, but share enough port keys
 * for most wires to carry over: a 3/2 valve between push-button, limit-switch and air-piloted
 * actuation (all three from `buildSlidingValve32Body`, sharing '1'/'2'/'3' - the air-piloted
 * variant's extra pilot port, '14', isn't on the other two), and a 5/2 valve between bistable
 * (valve52.ts) and monostable/spring-return (valve52Mono.ts) - they share '1' through '5' and
 * '14', but only the bistable one has a second pilot port, '12'. Either way, a wire on a port
 * that doesn't exist on the new component is dropped rather than reconnected somewhere invalid,
 * instead of silently becoming an invisible, un-removable connection with nowhere to land.
