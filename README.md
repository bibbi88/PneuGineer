# PneuGineer

PneuGineer is a light pneumatic simulation program aimed solely for educational purposes. Currently only the most vital functions and components are present. Future development might add more components, but the aim is only to focus on flow logic, not flow calculations. 

Currently the interface is in Swedish, but will be available in English in the future.

The project can be packed in a single HTML file, but this published version must be runned as a webserver. The easiest way is to use python. Open the folder and run following code "python -m http.server 8000".

AI has been used largely during development.
