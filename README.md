# PneuGineer

PneuGineer is a light pneumatic simulation program aimed solely for educational purposes. Currently only the most vital functions and components are present. Future development might add more components, but the aim is only to focus on flow logic, not flow calculations. 

Currently the interface is in Swedish, but will be available in English in the future.
